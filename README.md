# Project 4, Capstone

### This was my final project at BrainStation.

I created SKAUTi as a tool for Photographers and Film Makers to organize images for location scouting. 

I used Firebase Storage for the image storage, and FireStore Cloud Database to store the details for each image (including the URL for the image in storage). The app was built using ReactJS.


I plan to continue building features into the app. I’ll create a separate repo for the continuing build.

#### Features to add:

###### Authentication (likely using Firebase auth)
###### Image sort -- allow sorting images based on: Project, Location, Date
###### Delete images
###### Image map -- plot location on Google map using location metadata from image 
###### Inspiration gallery -- show other users images 




### Note – I have turned off access to the storage and DB, so you won’t be able to add new images.
